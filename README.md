# REST API with Node.js and Express

In this Node.js and Express REST API project, I showcase the implementation of functionalities for managing patients' medical records. The demonstration encompasses retrieving medical records, updating personal information like addresses and phone numbers, adding new patients to the system, and deleting existing patient medical records from the database. The entire process is facilitated using Postman, which serves as a tool for sending API requests and testing the code. By presenting these key operations, the project provides insights into building a robust and versatile RESTful API for healthcare data management using the Node.js and Express frameworks, ensuring seamless interactions with patient records

<h2>Learning Outcome</h2>
From completing this project I was able to understand how REST API works as well as learning that REST API is scalable, felixible and also caching is easier since the server is stateless and each request can be processed individually.

A RESTful API is an architectural style for an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to access and use data. That data can be used to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data types, which refers to the reading, updating, creating and deleting of operations concerning resources.
